# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network gorli
Output:-
0xf4f2BC7c562A6f93A132513EA9aC1DDc26cBb37e Collection contract address
0x0398E283FcDB46136c0ffc001592cd71eefaD731 Collection Factory contract address

npx hardhat verify COPY-PASTE-Collection Method-HERE --network gorli
npx hardhat verify COPY-PASTE-Collection Factory-ADDRESS-HERE --network gorli COPY-PASTE-Collection Method-HERE
```
